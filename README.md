## Description

Cloud-based file storage is an extremely conveinent way to store and share files. However, nearly all cloud storage solutions require you trade privacy and independence for speed and conveinence. Galaxy strives to be the way to get the best of both worlds. Galaxy is a completely open source, self hosted, privacy friendly file hosting service. The interface is extremely minimalist and lightweight, making it one of the fastest and most efficient cloud storage systems on the planet.
