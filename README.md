# Galaxy

An independent way to host and share files.


## Description

Cloud-based file storage is an extremely convenient way to store and share files. However, nearly all cloud storage solutions require you trade privacy and independence for speed and convenience. Galaxy strives to be the way to get the best of both worlds. Galaxy is a completely open source, self hosted, privacy friendly file hosting/sharing service. The interface is extremely minimalist and lightweight, making it one of the fastest and most efficient cloud storage systems on the planet. Instead of falling back to slow, frustrating, and proprietary file transfer methods, Galaxy makes it quick and easy to any authorized user to share files with any other user on your instance.
